:sparkles: Free VPS That Actually Exists™️ by EclipseSystems

Yes, you read that right. No, it’s not a trap. (Atleast for now)

No, we don’t want your credit card. No, we won’t ask for your blood type. 

Just bring your own IPs and SSH keys, and we’ll hand you a VPS like it’s candy on Halloween. :candy:

Get your zero-dollar VPS now (We double-checked the math. Still 0$)

Passwords? Ewwww. That’s so 1995. We use SSH keys like civilized beings. 

Specs that slap:

Dedicated 2–4GB DDR4 REG ECC 2400MHz RAM (ECC, cause we care about your bits)

100GB of dedicated storage (not shared with our cat pics storage)

6 shared vCores (they play nice)

> **Disclaimer**: If you try to mine crypto or host 4K cat video archives, we might gently suggest therapy. Also, limited stock. Like, actually limited. First come, first VPS’d.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: :cat: Pixel cat mascot not included. But spiritually present.
